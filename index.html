								<h2>Who am I?</h2>
							</header>
							<span>
								I graduated from <a href="https://www.haverford.edu/" target="_blank">Haverford College</a> with a double major  in computer science and religon (more specifically religion's influence on modern social ethics). I chose computer science because of it's unique need for both strict logic and artistic creativity, and to this day it is what keeps me excited about the field. Religion, is shockingly similar, its foundation is ethical rather than logical, yet it inspires a similar need for creativity and imagination in order to craft arguments for how we should or can live together as humans. My thesis in religion used Black feminist theory and queer theory to develop a new and more holistic understanding of the social practice of covering, and my thesis in computer science focused on video games designed to treat/prevent dyslexia. In my free time I like to read (primarily black feminist queer and abolitionist literature), lift, play basketball, teach, and go to drag shows.

									<p>The power outage hub was designed for a client of IBM, the goal of the project was to improve the client's customers experience. I built out a django webapp with internal and external facing dashboards. The client facing (external) dashboard consisted of saftey informaiton, a radar, and a map of outages in the clients area. The internal dashboard was executive facing and consisted of customer care and power outage KPIs. The app was built with Django, deployed through Docker and kubernetes, and utilized IBM Cloud services such as cognos, dashboards, and watson assistant.</p>

									We began by plotting a regression line for each country to map their CO2 emmissions as a function of agricultural expenditures. Then using the slope of these lines and a "social good" metric we created as features, we used K-means to cluseter the countries to find reccommended investments. </p>
